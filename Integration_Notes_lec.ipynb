    "The second point is crucial. Oftentimes, non-trivial parts of the integrand is found at the boundary points. As we shall see in the next section, we will usually encounter such problems that may only be resolved by an analytic application of L'hopital's rule. Unless you want to teach your integration scheme the basics of algebra and calculus, then it would be ideal if we can simply ignore boundary values as much as possible."
